# Image-to-CSV-Data-Extraction

### Abstract

This project offers a Python-based solution for automating data extraction from images and converting it into structured CSV files. Focused on problem solving, it addresses specific cases where each image represents a unique data format. The tool simplifies the digitization of information from various physical documents, such as reports and forms, by converting them into ready-to-analyze CSV files. By eliminating the need for manual data entry, this project provides a practical solution for managing diverse data formats across multiple documents.
